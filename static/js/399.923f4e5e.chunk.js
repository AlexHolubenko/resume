I\u2019m from South of Ukraine. After school, I moved to Lviv and entered the Lviv Polytechnic National University in Computer Science. After greduating I started working as a sushi maker. When I used to work there I realized that cooking is not my vocation and I would have to try something else. So I got into web development. In December I joined to Binariks training center. After a few months of studying and working on a project, I finally ready to get a job.
