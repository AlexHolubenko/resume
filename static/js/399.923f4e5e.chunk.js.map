I’m from South of Ukraine. After school, I moved to Lviv and entered the Lviv Polytechnic National University in Computer Science. After greduating I started working as a sushi maker. When I used to work there I realized that cooking is not my vocation and I would have to try something else. So I got into web development. In December I joined to Binariks training center. After a few months of studying and working on a project, I finally ready to get a job. If you’re reading this you’re probably looking for a front-end developer in your team and, of course, you can call me or write email (both contacts given on the top) and I will be happy to help you.</p>\n        <p>During university life, I started playing a guitar. I joined the band that played heavy music. At a particular moment, I could have changed my life direction and became a musician. It didn’t happen, but the love for playing guitar remained, and  it is still my hobby. Also, I’m interested in books. I haven't chosen one genre to read. I prefer a variety of genres - history, psychology, philosophy, fiction and so on. My favorite authors are Haruki Murakami, Theodore Dreiser, Anjey Sapkowski, Yuval Noah Harari.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"about-me__icons-group\">\n        {icons}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nexport default AboutMe;"],"names":["icons","studentIcon","programmerIcon","guitaristIcon","readerIcon","adventurerIcon","map","item","idx","src","alt","className","aboutMePhoto"],"sourceRoot":""}
